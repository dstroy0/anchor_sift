"""harness.py - the one entry point for tools/.

Everything under tools/ is reachable from here, so `harness.py help` is the whole surface and
`harness.py list` is the whole inventory:

  list          every script under tools/, grouped, with its flags and what it writes
  help          every command's help in one call, or one command's

  ci            hand off to tools/ci_tooling/ci.py: gen, check, baseline, cov, fmt, sonar
  convert       the module conversion family: scan, gen, shape, pimpl, funnel, nsmap
  edit          mechanical source edits: move, comments
  view          read-only readers: png, nodeset, tree, conform
  measure       includes, pid, and the three standing probes
  crypto        test vectors and keys
  assets        diagrams, theme previews, favicons, svg tooltips
  hooks         git: commit, install, status, cspell, dependabot
  build         THE BUILD: modules, suites, cmake, split - plus envs, ccache, psram
  selftest      run the tools' own self-tests
  doc gen       regenerate the derived tables in tools/TOOLS.md

The point is discovery. Half these scripts have names that do not say what they do, which is how
the same tool gets written twice - and a tool nobody can find gets written a second time. One entry
point means what a session learns about driving the tooling does not have to be re-derived.

HOW THIS TREE BUILDS - READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING A BUILD FILE

  A MODULE DECLARES ITSELF. Every CMakeLists.txt under src/ states what its module is, what gates
  it and what it needs, and is EDITED BY HAND - it is the source, not output. `build modules` no
  longer writes them; it reads the sources the compiler reads and reports where a declaration and
  its .c disagree: a dependency included but not declared, a gate the source carries and the
  declaration does not, a declared dependency nothing includes.

  A MODULE IS A DIRECTORY. One .c, the .h beside it, and the CMakeLists.txt declaring it. A new
  .c/.h pair dropped beside an existing one is wrong - `build split` moves it into its own
  directory and rewrites every reference.

  A SUITE IS A DIRECTORY TOO, and declares itself the same way: its test file, whatever sits beside
  it, and whether it writes its own main() or takes the generated Unity runner. An env names the
  suite it runs; it does not repeat that suite's files.

    build modules    check every declaration under src/, vendor/, include/ and test/core_setup
    build suites     check every declaration under test/unit and test/env
    build cmake      test/CMakeLists.txt: one target and one ctest per env
    build split      a pair still sharing a directory (dry run by default)

  Dependencies are read out of what each module includes, split by WHICH FILE included it: a
  header's includes are PUBLIC (they propagate, and only they can close a cycle), a .c's are
  PRIVATE. Two .c files calling each other's published handle is ordinary C, not a cycle.

  CTEST RUNS THE TESTS. Every one of them, every time, at 0.06 s per test:

    tools/harness.py build cmake                                  regenerate test/CMakeLists.txt
    cmake -S test -B build/native
    cmake --build build/native -j                                 incremental; -- -k for every failure
    ctest --test-dir build/native -j                              the whole matrix
    ctest --test-dir build/native -R native_<env> --output-on-failure    one env

  `test/harness.py run <env>` compiles an env from scratch by itself and does not read the CMake.
  A from-scratch single-env compile is slower than building and running the WHOLE matrix here, so
  it is never the faster check and never the right first move. Build with cmake, run with ctest.

A HWCAP IS NEVER REMOVED. NOT ONCE, NOT TO MAKE A LINK SUCCEED.

  A capability arm is a `#if PROTOCORE_HAS_HW_<X>` half and a `#if !PROTOCORE_HAS_HW_<X>` half.
  Both ship. When an env fails to link a symbol a hw arm defines, that is the CAP BEING OFF, and
  the fix is to turn it on and build the arm - never to swap in the portable half, never to delete
  the hw source from the env, never to drop the flag.

  A hw arm that lives in src/ and calls vendor silicon MOVES to test/core_setup/hal/<vendor>/ and
  is guarded there. It does not get deleted: moving it is what keeps the vendor cap testable on
  the host. Both arms always stay.

  THE HOST DRIVES EVERYTHING - BOTH ARMS. The two halves are mutually exclusive, so one env cannot
  hold both: give each its own env, same suite in both.

    env add native_x_sw --after native_x --clone native_x
    env update native_x_sw --drop-src <host arm> --src <portable arm> \
                           --drop-flags=-DPROTOCORE_HAS_HW_X=1 --flags=-DPROTOCORE_HAS_HW_X=0

  Audit before finishing any matrix work. Every hit must be a path rename, not a removal:

    git diff test/test_matrix.json | grep "^-" | grep -iE "hal/|_hw|HW_"

THE TWO THINGS THAT COST THE MOST TIME

  1. `--dry` FIRST, ALWAYS, on every writing subcommand. `convert gen`, `convert pimpl`,
     `convert funnel` and `convert nsmap` all take it, and it prints the diff it WOULD apply while
     writing nothing. The dry run is what catches a wrong result-member name, a mangled include,
     and a benchmark that would silently stop measuring anything. Read it before it lands, not
     after.
  2. NEVER hand-edit a generated region. Every generator under ci_tooling/generate/ takes
     `--check`, which is what CI gates on, so a hand edit inside a region is reverted by the next
     `harness.py ci gen` and reported as drift in between. Change the generator.

WHERE A TOOL GOES

  ci_tooling/check/       fails CI on a violation, writes nothing
  ci_tooling/generate/    writes into a tracked file, always through lib/doc_region.py
  ci_tooling/lib/         imported, never run
  ci_tooling/coverage/    coverage planning, running, report merging
  crypto/                 test DATA: vectors and keys
  dev_env/                the conversion tools and the readers, for a session, not for CI
  git-hooks/              the hooks themselves

  Read tools/ci_tooling/README.md before adding anything to ci_tooling: three generators had
  already solved the prettier collision with `prettier-ignore` fences when a fourth was written,
  did not know, and invented a second mechanism that silently disabled the drift detection it was
  meant to provide.

ADDING A TOOL IS THREE STEPS

  1. write it in the directory above that matches what it does
  2. add one line to the table in this file, with a usage and a hint that says the thing a first
     run gets wrong - the hint is the whole reason this file is worth reading
  3. `harness.py doc gen` - tools/TOOLS.md's tables are derived from the code, so the flags, the
     write primitives and the external commands come out of the file itself, not out of a
     docstring. A docstring is a claim; treat one that disagrees with the table as the thing that
     is wrong. Forgetting this step is caught rather than silent: CI runs the same generator as
     `ci gen --check tools_inventory` on every pull request, and regenerates it on push to main.

THIS IS NOT THE TEST HARNESS. test/harness.py owns the test matrix, the native runs, bare metal
and the benchmarks, and it is the one entry point for all of those. Nothing here writes
test/test_matrix.json, and nothing here should: a whole-file re-render is valid JSON and reformats
all 400 envs, so the diff stops naming what changed.
