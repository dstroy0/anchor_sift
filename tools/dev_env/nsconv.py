"""Shared call-rewriting primitives, correct about the three things my ad-hoc converters got wrong:

1. String and character literals. A '(' or ',' inside "a\"b" or ')' is not syntax, so every scan
   here steps over literals rather than counting their characters.
2. Where staging goes. A converted call becomes several assignments plus an entry call. Those are
   statements, so they belong above the whole enclosing STATEMENT - never at the start of the line
   the call happens to sit on, which inside a multi-line macro argument list is between the macro's
   arguments and does not compile.
3. Loop conditions. `while ((n = f(x)) > 0)` re-evaluates the call every iteration; hoisting it
   above the loop calls it once and spins forever. The tool cannot rewrite that faithfully, so it
   refuses and reports instead of guessing.
