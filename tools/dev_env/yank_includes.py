"""Move a header's #include lines down into the files that include it.

A header that includes another header hands every consumer a dependency it never asked for and hides
what a translation unit actually needs. This takes the includes out of the header and puts them in
each .c that reaches it, immediately before that file's own include of the header, so what a TU
compiles against is stated in the TU.

Dry run by default; --go rewrites in place.

    python tools/dev_env/yank_includes.py src/memoria_operor/memoria_operor.h
    python tools/dev_env/yank_includes.py src/memoria_operor --go

What it refuses, and why each refusal is right:

  * an include inside `#if` / `#ifdef` - it is conditional on something the consumer may not have
    settled, so moving it changes when it is read. Pass --conditional to take those too.
  * an include the consumer already has - nothing to add; the header's copy is still removed.
  * a header no .c reaches - removing its includes would break it with nothing to catch it, so it is
    reported and left alone unless --orphan is given.
  * the entry-point headers (mmgr_config.h and mmgr_types.h) - every file's first include by
    design. Named in KEEP below.
