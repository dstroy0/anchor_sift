"""Three reading passes over a MMgr module. Writes nothing.

  code <module.h> ...     comments stripped: the structure, with nothing to take on trust
  blind <module.h> ...    comments stripped AND every name this project chose replaced, so the code
                          is read for what it DOES rather than for what it is called
  claims <module.h> ...   every comment paired with the code it sits above, so the prose can be
                          checked against what the code does instead of read as if it were true

WHY BLIND. A name is a claim, and it is the one claim that never gets checked: a function called
`verify` is read as verifying, an `ok` member is read as an outcome, a `_reset` entry is assumed to
clear something. With those names replaced, only what the statements actually do is left. Anything
that then looks wrong IS wrong, rather than being a mismatch the reader was primed not to see.

WHAT BLIND KEEPS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A GENERIC RENAMER. This tree has one shape, and the shape is
grammar rather than vocabulary: an entry is a function-pointer member of an `<X>Ns` table, operands
are members of `<X>V`, state is sliced out of `MMGR_<X>_BORROW` at `<X>_OFF_*` offsets under a
static_assert. Blinding that away would leave text no one can check conformity against. So the
suffixes and the fixed vocabulary survive and only the IDENTITY moves:

    ConfiniumNs ConfiniumVars ConfiniumV ConfiniumCtx  ->  X1Ns X1Vars X1V X1Ctx
    MMGR_CONFIN_BORROW CONFIN_OFF_W                    ->  MMGR_X1_BORROW X1_OFF_A
    mmgr_persistent_buf_alloc                          ->  mmgr_fn3
    mmgr_word, uint8_t, size_t, static_assert, atomic_load  ->  unchanged

What is left reads as "an entry, taking the borrow, casting a region at an asserted offset" with no
opinion about whether that region is a hash state or a parser. That is the question worth asking.

Run `blind` FIRST, form a judgement, then `code` or `claims` to put the names back. The legend is
written to a file and never printed, because reading it in the same breath undoes the pass.

Comment removal uses strip_comments.rewrite - the literal-aware one already in the tree - not a
regex: `//.*$` truncates "http://x", and a non-greedy /*...*/ eats a "/*" inside a string literal.

Usage:
    python tools/dev_env/readclean.py code   PATH [PATH ...]
    python tools/dev_env/readclean.py blind  PATH [PATH ...] [--legend FILE] [--keep NAME,...]
    python tools/dev_env/readclean.py claims PATH [PATH ...]

A PATH is a module header (its .c is read with it), a single file, or a directory.
