"""Self-test for readclean.py: what the blind pass removes, and what it must NOT remove.

Both halves are load-bearing. A pass that removes too little leaves the names it was meant to take
off; a pass that removes too much leaves text nothing can be checked against - and the second is the
easier mistake to ship, because the output still looks blinded.
