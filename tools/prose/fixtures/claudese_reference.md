Let's dive into what we're really doing here.

At its core, this initiative isn't just about removing a few awkward phrases — it's about
fundamentally reimagining how technical documentation communicates with its readers. And that's a
crucial distinction worth unpacking before we go any further.

## The Challenge We're Facing

Documentation quality is one of those problems that seems simple on the surface but reveals
surprising depth once you start to delve into it. Think of it like an iceberg: the banned phrase
list is just the tip, while the real substance lies beneath.

Here's the thing. When we talk about "machine-written prose," we're really talking about a
constellation of subtle signals — word choice, sentence rhythm, the tendency to explain rather than
state. It's not just one thing; it's the interplay of many things working together. And that
interplay is precisely what makes this such a compelling problem to tackle.

Consider the following:

- **Vocabulary drift.** Certain words become overrepresented, creating a kind of lexical
  fingerprint that's remarkably consistent across documents.
- **Structural patterns.** Clauses that restate what was just said, rather than advancing the
  argument, are a hallmark of this register.
- **Rhythmic uniformity.** Sentences tend toward a similar length and cadence, which can feel
  polished but ultimately reads as flat.

Each of these plays a crucial role in the overall picture. Let's explore them one at a time.

## Our Approach: A Multi-Layered Framework

The solution we've developed leverages a robust, three-stage filtering architecture. This isn't
just a list of forbidden words — it's a comprehensive framework for thinking about register at
multiple scales simultaneously.

### Stage One: The Alphabet Layer

First and foremost, we examine spelling conventions. This foundational layer serves as a powerful
signal for locale identification. It's worth noting that this stage, while seemingly trivial, often
yields the most immediately actionable insights.

### Stage Two: The Word Layer

Building on that foundation, we then turn our attention to vocabulary. This is where things get
really interesting. Individual word choices can illuminate not just *who* wrote something, but
*when* — a fascinating capability that opens the door to entirely new analytical possibilities.

### Stage Three: The Phrase Layer

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we analyse multi-word constructions. These structural
patterns represent the deepest and most reliable signal in our entire toolkit. In many ways, this
layer is the crown jewel of the whole approach.

## Why This Matters

You might be wondering: why go to all this trouble? It's a fair question, and the answer speaks to
something fundamental about how we build software.

Documentation isn't merely a nice-to-have — it's the primary interface between a codebase and the
humans who need to understand it. When that interface is cluttered with filler, readers don't just
lose time; they lose trust. And trust, once lost, is notoriously difficult to rebuild.

Moreover, there's a deeper principle at stake here. A tool that measures its own prose is a tool
that takes its own standards seriously. That kind of intellectual honesty is invaluable, and it's
something we should absolutely be striving for in every project we touch.

## Implementation Considerations

Let's walk through some of the key considerations that shaped our implementation.

**Performance.** We wanted a solution that could scale seamlessly across a repository of any size.
By leveraging efficient regex compilation and a streamlined single-pass architecture, we were able
to achieve exactly that.

**Extensibility.** The framework needed to be flexible enough to accommodate future requirements.
Our modular design facilitates easy extension without requiring wholesale refactoring.

**Accuracy.** Perhaps most crucially, we needed to minimize false positives. Nobody wants a tool
that cries wolf. Through careful calibration and empirical validation, we've been able to strike a
delicate balance between sensitivity and specificity.

## Lessons Learned

This journey has been illuminating, to say the least. Here are some of the key takeaways:

1. **Measurement beats intuition.** Time and again, our assumptions were overturned by data. It's a
   humbling reminder that even experienced practitioners can fall prey to confirmation bias.
2. **Context is king.** A phrase that's problematic in one register may be perfectly appropriate in
   another. There's no one-size-fits-all solution here.
3. **Iteration is essential.** Our first attempt was fundamentally flawed. Our second attempt was
   better but still incomplete. It was only through successive refinement that we arrived at
   something genuinely useful.

## Looking Ahead

So where do we go from here? There are several exciting avenues worth exploring.

We could extend the framework to encompass additional languages, unlocking insights across a much
broader corpus. We could integrate more sophisticated statistical techniques to further enhance
detection accuracy. Or we could focus on tooling — building out a seamless developer experience
that makes adoption effortless.

Ultimately, the path forward will depend on the needs of the project and the appetite of its
maintainers. But one thing is clear: the foundation we've laid here is robust, extensible, and
well-positioned to support whatever comes next.

## In Conclusion

To sum up, what we've built here is more than just a linting tool. It's a lens through which we can
examine our own writing with fresh eyes — and, in doing so, hold ourselves to a higher standard.

The road ahead won't always be straightforward. There will be edge cases, disagreements, and
moments where the right answer isn't obvious. But that's precisely what makes this work so
rewarding. At the end of the day, we're not just cleaning up text; we're cultivating a culture of
craftsmanship that will pay dividends for years to come.

I hope this overview has been helpful! Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any particular
aspect of the approach, and I'd be more than happy to dive deeper.

Happy documenting!
