harness.py - the one entry point for the native test matrix.

`run` IS CMAKE AND CTEST. 0.06 s per test, and the build is incremental:

    harness.py run                  the whole matrix
    harness.py run native_telnet    one env, and every suite it runs

which is `tools/harness.py build cmake`, `cmake --build build/native -j -- -k 0`, then `ctest`.
Those three are the same thing spelled out, and are what to reach for when reading a build error:

    cmake --build build/native -j -- -k 0    keep-going is load bearing: without it the build stops
                                             at the first failing target and the other 30 stay
                                             hidden. THE SPELLING IS THE GENERATOR'S: ninja wants
                                             `-k 0` and make wants a bare `-k`, and giving ninja
                                             the bare one makes it print its usage and build
                                             nothing - a build that did not happen, reported as a
                                             build that found nothing wrong. `run` reads the
                                             generator out of CMakeCache.txt and picks.

BUILD WHAT YOU CHANGED, NOT THE MATRIX. A whole-matrix build is 9556 objects and about twelve
minutes; a handful of targets is seconds. While a change is still being iterated on, name them:

    cmake --build build/native -j --target native_sha384_kat native_x509_verify -- -k 0
    ctest --test-dir build/native -R "^(native_sha384_kat|native_x509_verify)$"

The full sweep is the ACCEPTANCE GATE at the end of a change, run once - not the edit loop. Reach
for it when a shared header moved (protocore_config.h, buffer_sizing.h, feature_en_error.h) or when
the change is finished and needs proving.

READ THE MODULE BEFORE WRITING THE TEST, AND READ IT BLIND FIRST:

    python tools/harness.py view read blind  src/crypto/hash/sha256/sha256.h
    python tools/harness.py view read code   src/crypto/hash/sha256/sha256.h
    python tools/harness.py view read claims src/crypto/hash/sha256/sha256.h

In that order, and not the other one. `blind` strips every comment AND replaces every name this
project chose, so the code is read for what it DOES rather than for what it is called - a suite
written after reading a doc block asserts the doc block, and passes against code that does
something else. Assume nothing: a name is a claim, and it is the one claim nothing ever checks.
`claims` is LAST, and it pairs each comment with the line it sits above precisely so the prose is
met with its subject instead of being taken on trust.

A TEST THAT ASSERTS A REMOVED CONTRACT IS THE STALE HALF OF THE CHANGE. When a suite fails because
src/ no longer does something, read git log for the commit that stopped doing it before "fixing"
src/ back. The borrow null-checks are the worked example: 350 `if (!work)` branches were deleted in
one commit, and the cases still asserting a null borrow is refused segfaulted because of it. The
answer was to delete those cases, not to restore 350 dead branches.

`run --direct` is the old path - it compiles each env by itself and never reads the CMake, so one
env through it costs more than building and running the whole matrix. --debug, --coverage and
--report-out imply it because each reads one env's own build or its own Unity output.

A HWCAP IS NEVER REMOVED FROM AN ENV. An unresolved symbol that a test/core_setup/hal/<vendor>/
arm defines is the CAP BEING OFF: turn it on and build that arm. Never swap in the hal/portable
half, never drop the hal source, never drop the flag - the env goes green and the arm the hardware
runs stops being tested, and nothing reports it. A hw arm in src/ MOVES to core_setup and is
guarded there; it is not deleted.

THE HOST DRIVES EVERYTHING - BOTH ARMS. The halves are mutually exclusive, so one env cannot hold
both. Give each its own env, the same suite in both `tests` lists:

    harness.py env add native_x_sw --after native_x --clone native_x
    harness.py env update native_x_sw --drop-src <host arm> --src <portable arm> \
        --drop-flags=-DPROTOCORE_HAS_HW_X=1 --flags=-DPROTOCORE_HAS_HW_X=0

Audit before finishing. Every hit must be a path rename, not a removal:

    git diff test/test_matrix.json | grep "^-" | grep -iE "hal/|_hw|HW_"

Everything the harness can do is a subcommand here, so `harness.py -h` is the whole surface:

  env add       splice a new env into test/test_matrix.json
  env update    change an existing env's flags / src / tests / extra_scripts (adds; --drop-* removes)
  env addsrc    add the same deps to EVERY env that builds a given .c
  env addflag   add the same flags to EVERY env that builds a given .c (how a gate is wired up)
  env gen       regenerate the generated block of platformio.ini from the matrix
  env select    map changed files to the envs they affect
  env list      print the envs the matrix defines
  env deps      rebuild test/dep_graph.json from the compiler include closure

  run           build the matrix with CMake and run it with ctest; --direct compiles here instead
  bare          cross-compile the core, and boot it on the part under QEMU
  bench         the microbenchmark matrix
  runners gen   the bridge to Unity's generate_test_runner.rb: what makes a suite runnable
  keys ensure   put the SSH test host key in place
  readme gen    refresh the generated sections of test/README.md
  report merge  overlay a partial TEST_REPORT.md onto the committed one
  report stable print TEST_REPORT.md with per-run timing blanked out

WRITING A TEST is four steps, all of them here:

  1. write test/<mirror>/test_<name>/test_<name>.c - file-scope `void test_<case>(void)`
     functions plus setUp/tearDown. The mirror path is the module's: src/a/b/c.c is tested
     from test/unit/src/a/b/test_c/, and `env add` refuses a suite that sits anywhere else.
  2. harness.py runners gen <suite dir>   -> Unity's generator writes unity_runner.c beside it
  3. harness.py env add <env> --after <anchor> --src <the .c files it needs>
  4. harness.py run <env>

Step 2 is the one with teeth: Unity's generator registers `void test_*` and NOTHING else, and a
function it walks past is not an error - the suite just passes without ever running it. `runners
gen` names any such function rather than letting the silence stand. Step 3 also wires the
pre-build hook (extra_scripts: pre:test/gen_test_runners.py), so step 2 re-runs on every build.

A DRIVER FOR A PART ON A BUS is not tested by priming bytes. test/core_setup/hal/host/devices/ holds a
device model per part, written from its datasheet with the section beside every constant, and the
host bus consults it by address:

    #include "devices/ads1115_device.h"
    static protocore_ads1115_dev s_part;
    protocore_ads1115_dev_place(&s_part, PROTOCORE_ADS1115_I2C_ADDR); // resets it, puts it on the bus
    s_part.ain_uv[0] = 1000000;                                      // 1.000 V on AIN0

The driver then composes its own transfers and the model answers them with its own arithmetic, so
a read is the part's response to what was written rather than a queue filled in transfer order.
protocore_bus_host_preload still works for a part that has no model yet; a model, once attached,
takes precedence for that address. protocore_bus_host_detach_all() empties the table.

Every test activity starts here. `bare` and `bench` are separate matrices in their own files
(test/bare.py, test/performance_benching/bench.py) because they answer different questions, but
neither is invoked directly: this is the one entry point, so what a session learns about driving
the tests does not have to be re-derived. `harness.py bare help` and `harness.py bench help` are
their full surfaces.

NEVER WRITE test/test_matrix.json WITH json.dump. Not from a script, not once, not "just this
one field". A whole-file re-render is valid JSON and reformats all 400 envs, so the diff stops
naming what changed and a reviewer cannot see the one env that did. There is no case where that is
the answer, and no flag to json.dump that avoids it.

Mutate it through a subcommand. `env update` ADDS to flags / src / tests (its --drop-* twins
remove), `env addsrc` fans one set of deps out across every env that builds a file, `env add` and
`env remove` splice a whole env in or out. If the change you need has no subcommand, ADD ONE here
next to these - that is cheaper than the script, and the next session gets it too.

A script that must touch the table imports this module and calls splice_replace / splice_after /
splice_remove, then write_verified, which re-parses and refuses a write that moved any env it was
not asked to move. Those five are the whole supported surface.

The matrix is the single source of truth. Every mutation takes the table's lock, splices text so
the file is not reformatted, and re-parses to prove no other env moved.

THE BUILD IS GENERATED CMAKE. src/ carries one CMakeLists.txt per module directory and test/ carries
one target plus one ctest per env, both written by tools/harness.py (build modules / build cmake).
They say "GENERATED ... Do not edit" and mean it - change the generator.

    cmake -S test -B build/native && cmake --build build/native -j && ctest --test-dir build/native

`run` regenerates that CMake first, so adding an env is `env add` and then `run` - nothing else.
`run --direct` is the old compile-it-here path: it reads test_matrix.json and invokes gcc itself,
so it never goes through the CMake and never proves it builds.
