"""Opening state for a viewer page, as parameters instead of edits to a template.

Every generator here takes --set key=value, repeatable, and passes the result through to the page.
It decides what the viewer looks like when it opens: which representation, where the observer is,
whether it turns on its own, what is already selected. A caller that wants a particular view asks
for it instead of publishing a page and telling the reader which controls to move.

    python tools/view/build_blob_view.py file.bin --set shape=hilbert --set spin=0.3
    python tools/view/build_field_view.py data.csv --set theme=light --set floor=20

Unknown keys are refused and never ignored. A typo in a setting is silent otherwise, and a page
that opens in the wrong state looks like a bug in the viewer.
