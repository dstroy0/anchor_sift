"""Turns a table into a flat chart: lines, time series, scatter, steps or bars.

The other viewers here build a solid you turn. This one is the ordinary two-axis chart, and it is
here for the readings that are honestly one dimensional: a quantity against time, one column against
another, a run of measurements you want to look along and not into.

matplotlib draws these too, and draws them well. What it does not do is hand you one file that opens
anywhere with no interpreter and no install, and stays interactive once it is open: hover to read a
point, drag across to zoom, toggle a series, switch the y axis to log. This therefore exists
beside it and not in place of it.

    python tools/view/build_chart_view.py readings.csv
    python tools/view/build_chart_view.py readings.csv --x time --y temperature pressure
    python tools/view/build_chart_view.py points.csv --kind scatter

  --x NAME       the column along the bottom. Default: the first column named one of time, t, x,
                 date, step, round, index, or failing that the first column that parses as numbers.
  --y NAME...    the columns to draw. Default: every other numeric column.
  --split NAME   a column whose distinct values split the rows into separate series, and is the
                 shape long-format data usually arrives in.
  --kind KIND    line, scatter, step, bar or area. Default line.
  --title TEXT   heading for the page. Default: the file's name.
  --out FILE     where to write. Default: <name>_chart.html beside the table.

Writes a self-contained page: no server, no fetch at run time, nothing to install.
