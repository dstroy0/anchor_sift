"""Turns any parametric table into the shape viewer, without knowing what the table is about.

The other generators here each read one measurement this repository produces. This one reads a CSV
and works out its own axes, so the same seven embeddings - plane, tube, toroid, sphere, cone, helix,
balloon - can be pointed at anything with the shape

    one value, measured over one depth axis, for each of many series

which is most measured data. Long format, one row per cell:

    kind,a,b,round,value
    residue,0,0,1,-31744.0
    residue,0,0,2,-30195.7

Usage, in the simple case where the columns are already named that way:

    python tools/view/build_field_view.py data.csv

and in the general case, naming the columns yourself:

    python tools/view/build_field_view.py data.csv --value amplitude --depth time --field sensor

  --value   the column holding the number to draw. Default: "value", else the last numeric column.
  --depth   the column that runs left to right. Default: the first of round, step, t, time, frame,
            depth, index that is present.
  --field   a column whose distinct values become the selectable fields. Default: "kind" if there
            is one, otherwise every row is one field.
  --title   heading for the page. Default: the file's name.
  --out     where to write. Default: <csv name>_view.html beside the CSV.

Every column that is none of those becomes part of the series key. A table indexed by two
parameters therefore draws one series per pair, and sorting the series by that key puts them
in a stable order along the cut.

Writes a self-contained page: no server, no fetch at run time, nothing to install.
