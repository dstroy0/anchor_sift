"""Sweeps the analysis and draws every setting at once, so an artifact of the analysis is visible.

A spectrogram is a picture of a signal and a picture of the window that made it, and nothing in the
picture says which is which. This runs the same signal through a whole range of settings, puts each
setting on its own row of one solid, and adds a field that is each setting minus the consensus of
all of them. A feature that stands in the same place at every setting is in the signal. A feature
that moves, or appears at one setting and not the next, is the analysis talking about itself.

    python tools/view/build_sweep_view.py take.wav
    python tools/view/build_sweep_view.py --synth --sweep pad

    python tools/view/build_sweep_view.py --synth --sweep fft --exact 256

  --sweep WHAT   fft, pad or window. Default fft.
  --fft N        frame size when it is not the swept axis. Default 1024.
  --pad K        zero-pad factor when it is not the swept axis. Default 4.
  --window W     window when it is not the swept axis. Default hann.
  --grid N       points on the common frequency axis. Default 512.
  --top HZ       highest frequency drawn. Default 8000.
  --average M    frames averaged per setting. Default 16, which steadies the noise floor.
  --exact BITS   run the sweep in extended precision as well, at frame sizes small enough to
                 afford it, so the arithmetic's own floor is below anything being looked for.
  --synth        use a generated signal: two tones beating at 3 Hz, a sweep from 1 kHz to 3 kHz, a
                 quiet 7 kHz tone and white noise.
  --out FILE     where to write.

Every setting is resampled onto one frequency axis in Hz, because settings do not share a bin
spacing and comparing bin 40 of one against bin 40 of another compares two different frequencies.
The axis is Hz for all of them, since Hz is what they share.
