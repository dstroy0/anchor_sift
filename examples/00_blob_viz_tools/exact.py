"""Arbitrary-precision transform, for when float64 is the thing being measured.

A double carries 53 bits of mantissa. That puts the arithmetic's own noise floor around 300 dB
down, which is far below anything in a recording and far above nothing. When the question is what
the analysis invents and not what the signal contains, the transform has to be quieter than the
effect being looked for, and that means leaving hardware floating point behind.

Everything here is decimal.Decimal at a precision you choose. Nothing is imported that is not in
the standard library, so pi, sine and cosine are computed here and never looked up: the module
math has no more precision to give than the double it returns.

    prec = digits_for(1024)          # bits to decimal digits, with guard digits
    re, im = transform(samples, prec)

Cost grows steeply. A 256-point transform at 1024 bits is seconds; a 4096-point transform at the
same precision is minutes. That is the price of the floor, and it is why the fast path in dsp.py
stays the default.
