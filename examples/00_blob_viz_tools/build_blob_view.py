"""Turns a raw binary file into the shape viewer, with no idea what the file is.

A blob has no columns and no header. Only one structure is available, the one every binary
has:
it is a sequence of bytes, and any sequence can be folded into a grid by choosing a width. Choose
the right width and repeating structure lines up into columns you can see; choose the wrong one and
it shears. That shearing is itself the reading, and width is therefore the first thing this exposes.

    python tools/view/build_blob_view.py firmware.bin
    python tools/view/build_blob_view.py firmware.bin --width 16 --offset 4096 --rows 4096

  --width     bytes per row, taken as the depth axis. Default 64.
  --offset    first byte to read. Default 0.
  --rows      how many rows to keep. Default 1024. Use 0 for the whole file.
  --window    span of the entropy and repeat windows, in bytes. Default 32.
  --title     heading for the page. Default: the file's name.
  --out       where to write. Default: <name>_view.html beside the blob.

Eight readings are built from the same bytes, because a blob rarely says anything under one of them:

  byte      the value itself, 0 to 255. Text, code, tables and padding each look distinct.
  ones      how many bits are set, 0 to 8. Discards value and leaves density.
  delta     each byte minus the one before. Zero is a run; a repeating delta is a fixed stride.
  entropy   Shannon entropy of the window around each position, in bits, 0 to 8. Flat and high is
            compressed or encrypted; low is structure.
  distinct  how many different byte values the window holds. Agrees with entropy on random data
            and disagrees on skewed data, which is where the interesting cases live.
  run       length of the run of identical bytes this position sits in. Padding and alignment.
  high      the top nibble alone, which is where ASCII ranges and opcode classes separate.
  low       the bottom nibble alone, which is where alignment and table strides show.

Writes a self-contained page: no server, no fetch at run time, nothing to install.
