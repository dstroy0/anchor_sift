#
# Two gaps, one pass, and they are one pass because either one alone hides the other: a build file
# such as CMakeLists.txt is opened by the extension list, and the alphabet stage reads the pattern
# the standard states and not a list of literals.
#
# A green run says the tool opens these files and sees these spellings. It does not say a hook runs
# it anywhere, or that a repository's roots reach a given file.

# GROUND TRUTH FOR THE ALPHABET STAGE

#
# Plain literals, written by hand, sharing no code with the patterns under test. "The stage reaches
# N of N" is then two independent enumerations agreeing, instead of a regex agreeing with itself.
#
# Held as a tuple of single-quoted strings, deliberately. A triple-quoted block here would be a
# docstring, prose_only keeps docstrings, and this tree's own run would then report every word in
# the list as a British variant, against the file that tests for British variants.
