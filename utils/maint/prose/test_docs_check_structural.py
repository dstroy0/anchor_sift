# Tests for the structural stage of docs_check. That stage fails a commit.
#
#   Usage:  python utils/maint/prose/test_docs_check_structural.py
#
# The stage is not tiered and --strict does not reach it. A false positive here is a commit that
# cannot be made. These are the hardest assertions in the suite and the counts below are derived
# from the tree at run time.
#
# Every count this file asserts on is measured when the test runs. A constant would have been
# correct on the day it was written and wrong on the day the tree moved, and the whole reason the
# structural stage needed repairing is that nobody had measured it outside orior.
