# A voice is read here as four signals taken off prose in the order it was written, each one
# through the voice's own tables:
#
#   characters  each character's rank in voice_alphabet.tsv, one sample per character.
#   words       each word's rank in voice.tsv, as log2(1 + rank), one sample per word. A word the
#               voice never used takes the rank past the last one.
#   lengths     each word's length in letters, one sample per word.
#   sentences   each sentence's length in words, one sample per sentence.
#
# A signal's harmonics are its power spectrum. The signal is cut into windows of WINDOW samples
# overlapping by half, each window has its mean taken out and a Hann taper applied, and the power
# of its Fourier transform is averaged over the windows. The constant term is dropped and the other
# bins are scaled to sum to one. Two spectra are compared by total variation, in [0, 1].
#
# A distance means nothing alone. This file also writes the band: blocks of the voice's own text,
# cut at each size in SIZES, each one measured against the spectrum of the other texts only. The
# held-out text is never in the reference it is measured against. A text is outside the voice on a
# signal when its distance is past the EDGE percentile of the held-out blocks of its size.
#
# Writes utils/maint/prose/voice_spectra.tsv (signal, bin, share) and utils/maint/prose/voice_band.tsv
# (signal, words, blocks, median, edge, worst). The ranks are the committed tables' ranks, taken over
# all six texts. A held-out block therefore sees ranks its own text helped set. That moves the
# common ranks by nothing a spectrum can see and is stated here because it is not held out.
