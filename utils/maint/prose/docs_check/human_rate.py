# What a construction costs a human writer, where that has been measured.

from .locale import LOCALE

# ====================================================================
# THE THREE STAGES, AND WHAT MEASURED THEM
# ====================================================================
# The list above is one flat table and it was built by noticing. utils/maint/prose/ban_evidence.py
# scored every pattern in it against 1,108,054 words of human research papers under build/papers,
# and against the 403,111 words of prose in this tree. That run split the table into three stages
# that filter at different widths, and the stages behave nothing alike.
#
# ALPHABET. Orthography, and it recovers the locale before it says anything about a writer. The
# papers are Canadian and British convention linguistics. Neighbour fires at 17.3 per hundred
# thousand words in them and analyse at 8.9, behaviour at 4.8, labelled at 2.9, centre at 2.3.
# None of that is machine prose. It is where the author is, and the American spellings this tree
# uses are a house rule and not a defect in anybody's English.
#
# WORD. Vocabulary, and the measurement mostly refutes it. Humans write crucial at 5.5, vital at
# 0.5, journey at 2.2, delve at 0.4, synergy at 2.4, utilize at 2.3 and leverage at 0.5. A ban on
# these removes ordinary academic English. They stay in the table because a house style is allowed
# to be narrower than the field, and they are reported as the weaker class they measured as.
#
# PHRASE. The structural shapes, and every one of them is confirmed. These nine appear 23.3 times
# per hundred thousand words in this tree and exactly zero times in 1.1 million words of human
# writing: is what separates and its family, is what makes, what survives, is the whole of, the
# X-not-Y grammar, that is the whole, and nothing more, what matters is, the one that matters.
# A clause that explains the sentence just written is the signature, and the phrase stage
# catches it.
#
# One caution the numbers earn. Absence from the papers is not proof a phrase is machine written:
# the papers are linguistics and a phrase can be missing because the domain is.
# Re-run ban_evidence.py after changing this table.
#
# MEASURED AGAINST THE MACHINE'S OWN PROSE, WHICH SETTLED IT
#
# utils/maint/prose/session_prose.py takes the machine's messages out of a session transcript. That
# corpus needs no label to be trusted, and it is the only one here whose author is not in question.
# 38,702 gated English words of it, against 759,815 of the papers, per hundred thousand words:
#
#   the whole list            643.4 machine     387.9 human   112.8 this tree
#   the eight phrase shapes    56.8 machine       0.0 human    26.4 this tree
#
#   rather                    240.3 machine      57.6 human      4.2 times the human rate
#   which is why/what/the     131.8 machine       3.2 human     41 times
#   so a                       46.5 machine       1.3 human     36 times
#   is the one                 43.9 machine       2.5 human     18 times
#   is exactly what/why/the    25.8 machine       0.4 human     65 times
#   and nothing else           12.9 machine       0.1 human    129 times
#   is what makes              10.3 machine       0.0 human     absent from 759,815 human words
#   the one that matters        7.8 machine       0.0 human     absent, and banned here by name
#
# Two things follow. The list was built by noticing and the noticing is accurate: the phrases
# called out by hand are the ones carrying the largest ratios. And every rate above is a floor,
# since the prose they are taken over was written with the same phrases under suppression.
#
# THE TIER IS NOT REFUTED BY HUMANS USING THESE WORDS. Humans do use them. The whole claim is a
# ratio, and the list is reached at well above the human rate. A reading that scores the words
# instead of the ratio says nothing, and a rate taken against an older corpus says less.

# The locale stage is defined above BANNED, because BANNED splices it in and a tuple has to exist
# before it can be spliced. It is one copy in one place and must stay that way.

# What each pattern costs a human writer, per hundred thousand words of the research papers.
# Measured, not estimated. A pattern absent from this table fired zero times in all 154 of them.
#
# Counted over 759,815 words, the papers after english_gate takes them down to English. The divisor
# has to be that gated count and not the raw 1,108,054 tokens, which carry the Salishan orthography,
# the interlinear glosses and the IPA that fill these pages. Dividing by the raw count puts every
# rate here about 40 percent low: rather reads 40.4 against 57.6, in order to 26.6 against 44.4.
