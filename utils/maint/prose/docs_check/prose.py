# The audit on the mechanism above, because the mechanism is easy to misuse. A marker pair protects
# a quotation, and a quotation has edges: it opens and closes where a sentence does. A pair reached
# for to silence a finding lands wherever the token sits, in the middle of a sentence. A correct
# pair closes on a finished sentence; a misused one closes on a fragment.
#
# Only the closing marker is tested. An opening marker sits above the quoted material in both shapes
# and tells them apart from nothing.
#
# Both halves of the tell have to agree before anything is reported: no sentence-ending punctuation
# before the marker, and a lowercase word after it. Either half alone fires on a table that ends in
# a bracket, or on a paragraph that happens to open lowercase.
#
# Reported and never errored. The evidence is six pairs, four correct against two misused, and the
# failure mode is a legitimate quotation of a fragment, which is a real thing to want to write. The
# one correct pair quoting two words closes cleanly because the sentence around it was written to
# close cleanly, and that will not hold for every future one. Raising this to breaking wants more
# pairs to have been right about, and not more confidence about six.
