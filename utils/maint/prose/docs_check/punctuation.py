# The smart-punctuation family, which is wider than the em dash.
#
# The quote characters below are the substitutions a word processor, a web paste or a well-meaning
# editor makes, and each has an ASCII form meaning exactly the same thing. The em dash is structural
# and em_dashes() errors on it. These report and never break, for two reasons: a quote inside a
# string literal or a test vector can change what a program means when it is ASCII-ised, and a
# person decides each site.
#
# THE EN DASH IS NOT IN THIS TABLE AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN OF THE CHECK.
#
# Listing it beside the em dash and advising a hyphen would be wrong. This corpus's en dashes are
# all doing semantic work: numeric ranges, and author pairs. Walsh-Hadamard tells a reader Hadamard
# might be a hyphenated surname; Walsh–Hadamard tells them it is two people. ASCII-ising it destroys
# information.
#
# The corpus settles the wider question with it. docs/ carries 74 U+2212 minus signs and a working
# set of arrows, inequalities and set operators. It is a mathematics corpus using mathematical
# characters deliberately, and "unicode punctuation is suspect" would be a rule imported from
# somewhere else. The em dash is banned because it is a stylistic tell carrying no information. The
# en dash carries information. One is errored on and the other is ignored, and this follows that.
#
# AND THE SAME RULE REACHES THE CURLY QUOTE, which is the whole reason MARK_SUBJECT exists.
#
# U+2019 is a stylistic substitution for an apostrophe in English prose and it is a LETTER in
# several of the orthographies this tree transcribes: the glottalization mark in Nuxalk and in
# Lyon's Okanagan. U+2018 and U+2019 are also the delimiters linguistics puts around a gloss, as in
# yidád 'fish trap'. ASCII-ising either destroys information exactly the way ASCII-ising an en dash
# does, and a run whose subject is the mark is held to the same exemption the en dash gets outright.
#
# BOUNDED TO THE RUN AND TO THIS STAGE. A paragraph about an orthography does not get to carry a
# banned construction; only a quote finding goes quiet, and only inside the run that names what the
# character is doing. The cost is reported by the exclusion ledger, so a reader counts it instead of
# trusting this sentence.

# The character, what to call it, and what to write instead. The em dash is absent because
# em_dashes() already errors on it and a second report of one site is noise.
#
# U+2018 IS ABSENT AND THAT IS THE RULE AND NOT AN OMISSION. Nothing writes an opening single quote
# as an apostrophe. Its presence in a run therefore says the run uses PAIRED single quotes, which is
# the gloss convention linguistics writes as yidád 'fish trap' and is a convention and not a
# substitution. So a closing one is read as a substitution only where there is no opening one to
# have closed, which is exactly the apostrophe case: Lyon's, doesn't, the paper's.
