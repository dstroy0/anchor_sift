# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# GENERATED REGIONS
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# REPORTED AND ATTRIBUTED, NEVER SUPPRESSED, and this is the single decision in this section a
# reader is likely to want to reverse. Here is the evidence against reversing it.
#
# A document can carry BEGIN and END GENERATED marker pairs that CI regenerates. An edit inside one
# is reverted by the next regeneration: the gate reports a fix, the fix disappears, and the finding
# comes back. That argues for skipping the region, and it is the wrong move.
#
# A genuine structural finding, an empty table say, can sit inside a generated region. A rule that
# skips marked regions deletes it and reports the tree clean. A generator that emits a header and a
# separator with no rows under them republishes an empty table on every regeneration. That is a
# generator defect, a person has to fix it in the generator, and the finding is how they find out.
#
# A FINDING INSIDE A MARKED REGION THEREFORE KEEPS ITS PLACE IN THE COUNT and carries the
# generator's name with it. The marker already holds the generator. The attribution is read from the
# document and cannot go stale. What the region buys is an error: a rewrite never goes inside one,
# because writing there is writing to a file CI overwrites.
#
# AND A SOURCE FIX IS PAIRED WITH REGENERATION. Where CI checks generated copies against their
# source, fixing the source without rerunning the generator fails the change that carried the fix.
# Skipping the generated copy is necessary and it is not sufficient. The error below names the
# generator and says to run it.
#
# AN UNCLOSED MARKER IS ITSELF REPORTED. A BEGIN with no END would otherwise annotate the rest of
# the file as generated, the fail-open shape this whole section exists against.
