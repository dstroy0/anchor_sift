# A quoted passage in a page: an opening double quote, a run of text, a closing one. Somebody
# else's words, and never this project's prose to repair. Jaynes is quoted twice in the ledger and
# once in an engine README, and joining wrapped lines put his wording in front of the scanner.
# Bounded to markdown, because a docstring's own """ marker would otherwise open a span that
# swallowed the rest of the file.

# THE LITERAL INDEX. Running every BANNED pattern over every run is 394 patterns against about
# 14,000 runs over this tree, 5.5 million regex scans and 96 percent of a 29 second hook, nearly
# all of them over text that cannot hold a match. So each pattern is parsed once for literal text
# that every match of it must contain, and a run is scanned only by the patterns whose literal it
# holds. `\bdelve` needs "delve"; `\bis (what|why|the)\b` needs "is ".
#
# It is a necessary condition and never a sufficient one, so it cannot add a hit or lose one. The
# regex still decides every finding. A pattern the parser cannot name a literal for goes into the
# always-run list and is scanned against every run. The patterns are matched with
# IGNORECASE, and so the run is folded the way re folds it: ASCII lowercased, and a non-ASCII
# character mapped to the ASCII letter re would let it match (the long s matches `s`, the Kelvin
# sign `k`, dotted capital I `i`). str.lower() is not that fold. It turns the dotted capital I
# into two characters and leaves the long s alone, and a prefilter built on it would drop a match
# re makes.
#
# test_docs_check_index.py holds the index to the brute force scan, hit for hit and in order.
