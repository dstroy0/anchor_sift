# The standard applied to the text a tool prints, which prose_only blanks along with the code.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE STAGE. prose_only reads the comments and docstrings of a source file and blanks
# everything else. For a library that is right. For a checker it is not: the tools in
# examples/00_blob_viz_tools each print several paragraphs of argument about what they measured, and
# a person reads those paragraphs the way they read a page. None of that text sits in a comment, so
# none of it reaches the scan, and a clean run says nothing about it.
#
# docs-check: quoting
# `quotient_coherence` prints 'which is the average of those two' and `reading_rank` prints
# 'which is why 64 distinct signatures out of 64 rounds is not evidence'.
# docs-check: end quoting
#
# Both phrases are on the banned table and both sit in text a reader sees.
#
# IT IS READ OFF THE PARSE TREE AND NOT OFF THE LINES. A string built across several lines is one
# literal to ast and is read once, and a sentence inside a comment is not read twice, because a
# comment is not in the tree at all. That is the whole reason this does not use a regex over the
# source.
#
# A PRINTED FINDING IS A PROSE FINDING and never a breaking one. The text reaches a reader the same
# way a page does, so it belongs in the same column under the same rule: a person decides each site.
