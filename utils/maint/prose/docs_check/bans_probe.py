# The tier an outside detector marked, sentence by sentence, in this tree's own prose.
#

PROBE = (
    # Tier six, and the first tier this file did not find by itself. A 340 word passage of
    # theory/theory/crystallography/chapters/chapter_whose_result.tex was scored by an outside
    # detector, which returned 80.4 percent machine written and marked which sentences carried
    # it. Every shape below is out of a marked sentence and was not already in the table above.
    #
    # The outside number is worth little on its own. A detector reading perplexity marks plain
    # declarative technical prose as machine written because that prose is low perplexity, which
    # is a property of the register and not of the author. What makes this tier worth adding is
    # that two unrelated instruments picked the same file: the eight patterns below were counted
    # across 53 documents before any was kept, and chapter_whose_result.tex is 26 lines long and
    # trips five of them, at lines 10, 16, 18, 20 and 24. No other file in the tree is that
    # dense.
    #
    # Counted first, per the rule the tiers above set: 11, 17, 3, and 1 apiece for the rest.
    #
    # The X-not-Y antithesis wearing definite articles. Line 30 and line 78 ask for a or an.
    # Therefore "the good outcome and not the bad one" walks past both of them.
    r"\b(is|was|are|were) the [\w-]+ and not the [\w-]+",

    # ---- Found by a detector probe rather than by a frequency table. ----
    #
    # A frequency comparison against a human corpus finds TOKENS. It cannot find a sentence whose
    # every word is ordinary and whose SHAPE is the tell, and those pass the gate and still read
    # wrong. This group is for that half.
    #
    # THE PROCEDURE FOR ADDING ONE, and it is the whole warrant for anything in this group. Write
    # prose in the register being hunted and score it per sentence, twice, with different wording
    # carrying the same shapes. Keep a sentence only if it scores high AND trips nothing already in
    # this tuple, and keep a shape only if it recurs across both batches, since one high score is
    # detector noise. Send no document from either tree anywhere: the register is the thing being
    # characterised, and prose about nothing characterises it as well as prose about the work, with
    # nothing at stake in it.
    #
    # Then run the candidate against the whole tree and read every line it matches. "not merely"
    # fails this test: every line it reaches is the deliberate X-and-not-merely-Y idiom this work
    # uses on purpose, so banning it removes a construction rather than a tic. That is the failure
    # to check for before anything is added here.
    #
    # One calibration note for anyone extending this. The detector scored "It was a warm
    # afternoon and the window was open" at 0.99, which looks like a false positive and is not
    # one: that sentence is scene-setting, which belongs to fiction, and in technical prose a
    # register mismatch is exactly what it reads. Narrative openers are a real shape here and no
    # pattern below reaches them, because a regex cannot see register. They still have to be
    # caught by eye.
