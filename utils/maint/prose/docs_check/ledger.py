# What was excluded and why, counted so a silence and a zero can be told apart.
#



# ====================================================================
# THE EXCLUSION LAYER. EVERY EXCLUSION ERRORS AND SAYS SO
# ====================================================================
#
# THE FOUR STAGES CALL IN HERE AND NONE OF THEM CARRIES A SKIP OF ITS OWN. A skip written four times
# is four places to forget it and four places for the four copies to drift apart. That is the same
# fault the note above LOCALE records about a rule table duplicated into the table that enforces it.
# There are three call sites and no others: prose_only applies the blanking rules once, and
# em_dashes, markdown_leftovers and banned_tokens therefore inherit them without knowing they exist;
# banned_hits applies the run-level context rules beside QUOTED; main() applies the file-level and
# region-level rules and prints what fired.
#
# NOTHING IS SKIPPED QUIETLY. "Scanned none" and "there are none" must never print the same
# nothing. So every exclusion below records what it dropped and why, into a Ledger, and main()
# prints that ledger under the counts. A file this tool declines to read is
# named by the run that declined to read it.
#
# EVERY EXCLUSION STATES ITS REASON IN THE SOURCE AND NOT ONLY ITS RULE. A bare list of paths is the
# kind of thing a later maintainer deletes as overcautious, and they are right to: a rule nobody can
# check is a rule nobody can keep. A list saying why survives.
#
# EVERY RULE HERE IS A FIRST-CLASS RULE AND NOT A SPECIAL CASE. Each one has a name, a reason, a
# measured cost and a test. A special case is a rule with none of those, and it is the thing the
# next person deletes.


class Ledger(object):
    """What a run excluded and why, kept so the run can say so.

    Held in first-appearance order, because the order an exclusion first fires is the order a reader
    meets the tree. Sites are kept whole and not only counted: the question after a surprising count
    is always which ones, and a ledger that cannot answer it sends a reader back to the source.

    A caller passing no ledger still gets the exclusion. Recording is the optional part, never the
    rule. A caller that has not been taught about the ledger cannot turn an exclusion off by
    forgetting to pass one.
