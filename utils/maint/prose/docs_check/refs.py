# REPORTING: A COUNT IS NOT A RESULT UNTIL IT SAYS WHAT IT COUNTED
# ====================================================================
#
# Three lines, and each one prevented a real confusion.
#
# PRINT THE REVISION MEASURED. One repository read 58 British sites on one branch and 15 on another,
# and the difference looked like a defect in this tool to two separate readers for most of a day. A
# count without its revision is a count about an unspecified tree. And a revision is only authority
# while it is REACHABLE FROM SOMEWHERE DURABLE: a local-only commit is a tree of one, and a fixture
# that lived only inside a linked worktree dies with the session that made it. So the revision is
# printed with its reachability, and "NOT PUSHED" is printed in those words when nothing on a remote
# contains it.
#
# PRINT THE ROOTS SCANNED AND THE ROOTS LOOKED FOR AND NOT FOUND. The closed-repository scan this
# tool once ran taught the reason, and it generalizes: "scanned none" and "there are none" must
# never be the same output, for any root and not only a closed one.
#
# PRINT THE ROOTS IT WAS CONFIGURED WITH, and this is the line that matters most. One repository
# declares roots = ["README.md", "test"] for both its prose gate and its commit hook. Its sixty
# translation units and its CMakeLists.txt are outside that declared scope, and they stay outside it
# after every repair this tool has had. A run reporting "0 findings" over two configured roots reads
# exactly like a clean tree, and that is how a repository carrying dozens of British spellings reads
# as green. The roots go at the top of the report, and a reader meets the scope before the count.
#
# AND SAY WHAT THIS TOOL DOES NOT ANSWER FOR. There are four independent reasons a finding survives
# a gate and each is sufficient alone: the hook is not installed, the declared roots exclude the
# file, the rule cannot match it, and the extension cannot be opened. This file owns the last two.
# The first two are per-repository decisions that change what every committer has to satisfy, they
# belong to each repository's captain, and a tool implying it has settled them is worse than one
# that says nothing. A gate that is correct, installed nowhere, and scoped to two paths still
# catches nothing. The footer says so in one line.

    handful of checkouts.
