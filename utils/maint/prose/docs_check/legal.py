# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# LEGAL BLOCKS: SPDX AND COPYRIGHT
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# An SPDX identifier and a copyright grant are legal artifacts, and the register of a license grant
# is the license's business. This tree carries a three-way LicenseRef line on every file of its
# own. Rewriting a word inside one edits the artifact.
#
# BLANKED PER BLOCK AND NEVER PER LINE. A GPL grant runs fifteen lines and two of them hold anything
# a regex can find. Blanking the two that matched would leave thirteen lines of legal text standing
# in front of the register scan. Carried from repo_tools/docs/docs_maint/ai_words.py, which this
# pass supersedes.
#
# WHERE A BLOCK ENDS IS THE WHOLE RULE, and getting it wrong in either direction is expensive.
# Splitting blocks on blank source lines is wrong: a `#` alone on a line is not blank, so a whole
# comment header reads as one block and every finding under it goes quiet. A block is split instead
# on MARKER-stripped emptiness, the same test runs() already makes, and again wherever the comment
# form changes or closes.
#
# WITH THAT RULE IT SILENCES NOTHING, because every legal block in every tree here is already clean
# prose, which is the outcome to want from a rule whose job is to protect an artifact. Re-derive
# that zero after any change to the block walker: a walker reaching too far reports the same zero.
#
# THE SHARPEST FIXTURE HAS BOTH HALVES IN ONE FILE A FEW LINES APART. A real copyright and SPDX
# pair is not ours to edit. Prose ABOUT a license block, sitting directly under it with no blank
# line between, says `licence` in ordinary British convention and a person may fix it. A block rule
# reaching one line too far takes the second with the first. What separates them is the change of
# comment form, from `#` to a docstring.
# the same shape with a blank line to help, and all four sites survive this rule.
