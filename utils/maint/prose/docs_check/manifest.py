# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# SIGNED MANIFESTS

#
# The most dangerous exclusion in this file, and the only one whose cost is not a question of taste.
#
# salishan_corpus/MANIFEST.tsv records the SHA-256, the byte count and the row count of 2028 files.
# AUDIO_MANIFEST.tsv records another 3. Both carry a detached signature beside them,
# MANIFEST.tsv.asc and AUDIO_MANIFEST.tsv.asc. Changing one byte of a listed file makes its hash
# wrong, fails the reconcile that repository runs before every commit, and invalidates a signature
# whose whole purpose is to attest what a published measurement was taken over.
#
# A LISTED PATH IS THEREFORE ERROR FOR REWRITING AND NEVER QUIETLY PASSED OVER, and a run that
# offered to rewrite anything in a tree carrying a manifest prints that manifest's own reconcile
# instruction under its output. The instruction is lifted from the manifest header and not written
# out here. It cannot drift from the tool that maintains it.
#
# WORSE HERE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE. The corpus is Salishan linguistics: Canadian and British convention
# throughout, and this file's own measurements put neighbour at 17.3 per 100k there, analyse at 8.9,
# behaviour at 4.8, labelled at 2.9 and centre at 2.3. Those are the source texts' own convention,
# they are what the hashes were taken over, and an alphabet-stage rewrite would change thousands of
# them and break every hash it touched.
#
# READING IS NOT WRITING, and this rule does not stop the scan. A listed file is read, and a finding
# in one is reported like any other, because reporting changes no bytes. Only the rewrite is
# errored.
