def path_candidate(target):
    """Whether a matched link target is a path at all, before asking whether the path is there.

    dead_links is a structural check and a structural finding fails a commit. A target this
    returns True about has to be something the filesystem can actually answer for. Two shapes wear
    markdown link syntax without being paths. Both were measured against a Doxygen C repository.

    Measured at ProtoCore f3e96f68, `python utils/maint/prose/docs_check <protocore>/docs` reported 251
    breaking findings where 4 were real. 244 were Doxygen references and 3 were C declarators. The
    gate is correct in orior, a tree of Python and markdown that uses no Doxygen. Pointed at a
    repository that does use it, the gate would have errored on every commit ProtoCore could make. That
    is why this test sits in front of os.path.exists instead of in an exemption list somewhere.

    Doxygen references, 244 of them. [`HTTP_10`](@ref HTTP_10) resolves against documented symbols.
    HTTP_10, HttpVersion, HttpReq::version, send_chunked, WS_FRAME_SIZE, MAX_HEADERS and
    PROTOCORE_ENABLE_KEEPALIVE were each confirmed as live symbols in ProtoCore's source. Every
    one of those findings reported a working cross-reference as a broken link.

    C declarators, 3 of them, at SECURITY.md:903, SSH.md:91 and SSH.md:94. A lambda in a fenced
    example writes `[](const char *user, const char *pass)`, and a parenthesized group following a
    bracketed one is the shape LINK looks for.

    Which signal earns its place. Across orior, ProtoCore, idemIP, MMgr and embedded_types,
    646 targets are skipped here and not one of them names a path that is on disk. Nothing that
    was a real finding has been silenced. 496 of the 646 are Doxygen commands and the other 150 hold
    a pointer star. Of the three declarator signals only the star fired. The type-keyword head and
    the comma-separated list caught nothing in those five trees and are kept for the parameter list
    that has neither star nor keyword, as in `(uint8_t slot, size_t len)`. The comma rule is the
    loosest of the three and is bounded to items of two words each. `docs/a.md, docs/b.md` stays
    a pair of paths.
