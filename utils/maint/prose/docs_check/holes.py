# The hole a repair leaves behind: a word taken out and the sentence left ungrammatical.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT PART OF THE SCAN. Every rule in BANNED is bounded tightly enough to report on any
# file in the tree. These are not: `the which` and a doubled article appear in quoted grammar
# examples, in test fixtures and in generated tables, and a tree-wide run of them reports mostly
# those. What makes them usable is scope. Read against only the lines a pass ADDED they report
# almost nothing but real holes, because a hole is made by an edit and a tree holds few of them.
#
# So this takes a unified diff and reads the added lines only. The deletions are what the pass meant
# to remove and the context is what it did not touch; neither can carry a hole the pass made.
#
# IT IS A SUSPICION AND NEVER A FINDING. Nothing here fails anything. utils/maint/prose/check_fixes.py names
# this fault, and the output is a list of lines to read.

import re

# A pattern and the fault it suspects. Each one is a shape English does not make, which is what lets
# a list this short stand in for reading every edited line.
