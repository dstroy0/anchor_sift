# Spellings that are somebody's name and never this project's prose. The International Conference on
# Salish and Neighbouring Languages spells its own name that way, and thirteen extraction scripts
# cite it in their headers. Americanizing a title misquotes it. A hit inside one of these is
# dropped before it is reported.
QUOTED = (
    re.compile(r"neighbouring languages", re.IGNORECASE),
    # The same title, wrapped across two comment lines by half the extraction headers.

# A span the writing sets off as a citation of a form. A token inside one is a NAME and not a USE,
# and that is the same reasoning QUOTED already carries for a proper name: the document is pointing
# at the token, not reaching for it.
#
# THIS IS THE HIGHEST-LEVERAGE PRECISION RULE HERE, and the way to see it is to run the checker
# over the two documents that authorize it. The overwhelming majority of what it reports on them
# sits inside one of these spans, and every one of those is the standard writing out a token it
# bans so a reader can see which token is meant. A checker that reports a standard for naming its
# own bans is reporting the wrong thing.
#
# THREE MARKERS. The backtick span is the bulk of it. The italic run is how both standards quote a
# banned shape too long to be a token: code-comments:161 writes *That is the difference between a
# helper naming a step and a helper costing a call* to show what an aphoristic clause reads like.
# The quoted span is the same device with quotes, and its floor is one character against PASSAGE's
# sixteen, because the named forms are short: *"Certainly!"* is ten characters and *"load-bearing"*
# is twelve, and both walk past PASSAGE.
#
# BOLD IS NOT A FOURTH MARKER AND MUST NOT BE ADDED. Bold marks a heading here far more often than
# it marks a citation, so the arm silences real TIER A findings sitting inside heading labels:
# "**What survives from F1/F2:**", "**Why it is deferred rather than fixed:**". It is a net loss.
#
# The italic arm errors on a span holding a table cell separator, because two unrelated asterisks
# in different cells pair across a row and swallow the text between them. A citation of a form does
# not straddle a cell boundary.
#
# WHAT THE ARM COSTS. On the two standards it removes findings in bulk, TIER A and TIER B both, and
# every one is the document writing out the token it bans. On ordinary source it removes almost
# nothing, and what it does remove is correct: `realm` in a fenced `on_http_auth(..., realm, ...)`
# signature and in a `WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="..."` header, which is an HTTP field name. NO
# TIER A FINDING IS SILENCED ANYWHERE OUTSIDE THE STANDARDS. A banned word that happens to sit in
# backticks anywhere goes quiet, the same trade QUOTED and PASSAGE already make. Bounded to
# markdown alongside PASSAGE, except the backtick span, which reads the same way in a comment and is
# where a comment names a symbol.
