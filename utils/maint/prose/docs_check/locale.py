# British convention against American, as a pattern and not as a list.
#


# ====================================================================
# THE LOCALE STAGE. BRITISH CONVENTION AGAINST AMERICAN, AS A PATTERN AND NOT AS A LIST
# ====================================================================
#
# code-documentation:149 states this rule in one sentence and states it as a shape: "Never a British
# variant, and the ban is on the pattern rather than on a list: no `-ise` or `-isation` where
# American takes `-ize` or `-ization`, no `-our` for `-or`, no `-re` for `-er`, no doubled `l` in
# `modelled`, `labelled`, `signalled`." code-comments:157 says the same thing shorter.
#
# ONE COPY. BANNED splices this tuple in directly, so a pattern added here is enforced here. A rule
# table duplicated into the table that enforces it drifts with no signal at all. Keep it spliced.
#
# THE NAMED PATTERNS BELOW ARE KEYS AND CANNOT BE REWRITTEN FREELY. HUMAN_RATE is keyed by pattern
# string and holds a measured rate for eight of them. Folding one into a general arm takes that rate
# out of submission_check.py's table with nothing to say it had gone. The general arms overlap the
# named ones, and banned_hits dedupes on (line, offset, token), so an overlap costs a wasted match
# and never a doubled finding.
#
# WHAT THE -ise ARM ENFORCES, worth a sentence because it reads as dialect detection and invites a
# correction toward Oxford. `-ise` is not reliably British; Oxford usage is `-ize`. A tree written
# in Oxford English trips none of this and a tree written in American English trips none of it
# either. The arm enforces a house American convention against one common British convention, and
# is not a claim about where the writer is from.
#
# THREE ARMS ARE DELIBERATELY ABSENT AND MUST STAY ABSENT.
#
#   An `-isable` arm matches `controldisable` and every other compound ending in `disable`.
#   A general doubled-l arm cannot be written: `controlled`, `installed`, `enrolled` and `spelled`
#   are American with two l's, so the doubled-l rule stays the named list the standard gives it.
#   A general `-re` arm cannot be written either: `are`, `here`, `more`, `figure` and `structure`
#   are the majority of English words ending in those two letters.
#
# The standard's sentence names four shapes and does not name the `ae` and `oe` digraphs
# (`haemoglobin`, `foetus`, `anaesthetic`). No arm is written for them, and a rule with no measured
# hit is a rule nobody can tune.

# The named forms, ahead of the general arms.
