# The exclusion layer and the reporting lines, checked instead of remembered.

#
# Standalone unittest, no pytest dependency, same as the three suites beside it.
#
# WHAT THESE TESTS ARE FOR. Every exclusion in docs_check is a rule that makes the tool report LESS,
# and a rule that makes a checker report less is the easiest kind of rule to get wrong and the
# hardest kind to notice being wrong. A wrong exclusion reports a clean tree. So each one here is
# asserted from both ends: what it silences and what it must NOT silence.
#
# EVERY COUNT IS DERIVED AT RUN TIME AND NONE IS WRITTEN DOWN. The manifest row count, the British
# convention cost, the legal block cost and the generated region membership are all measured from
# the tree when the test runs, and the ref they were measured at is printed with its reachability.
# Numbers hand-carried through this tree have been wrong repeatedly: the brief for this work said a
# manifest held 2028 rows and a read pass said 2029, and both were describing the same file with the
# header row counted differently.
