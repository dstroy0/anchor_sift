# Reads the text voice_pdftotext.sh wrote to build/voice/text/. Each file holds one row per distinct
# word, the word and how many times it occurs. Neither carries a sentence or an order of words, only
# the counts.
#
# A word is a run of letters, with an apostrophe allowed inside it (don't, Newton's). The text is
# folded to NFKC first, which turns the ligature ﬁ into fi, and the typographic apostrophe is read
# as the plain one. A word broken across a line with a hyphen is joined back, since the break is the
# typesetter's. Case is folded: a word opening a sentence is the same word.
#
# The tally is sifted with the tests english_words() in english_gate.py applies, and nothing is
# dropped. A word that passes goes to voice.tsv, most frequent first. A word that fails goes to
# voice_review.tsv for a person to read, with the test it failed, ordered by english_sift.surprise
# with the least English first. A single word has few byte pairs. Its score orders the list and
# decides nothing.
#
# The tests are applied to the word, over every place it occurs. A capitalized heading does not
# pull the word out of the prose: a word is a gloss label only when every occurrence is in capitals.
# A single letter is exempt from that test, because the pronoun I is always a capital. One test is
# added to english_gate's: a single letter other than a and i is pulled. The letters without a vowel
# already fail, and e, o, u and y alone are the variables of the equations.
