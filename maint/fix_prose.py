"""Applies prose rewrites from a table, one exact site at a time, and refuses a bad one.

Written after fixing eighty-five findings by hand. The hand work is the right shape and the risk in
it is mechanical: a rewrite that matches nothing leaves the finding standing while the run looks
successful, and a rewrite that matches twice edits a site nobody read. Both are the failure this
whole day has been about, so both are errors here.

    python maint/fix_prose.py                    # report what would change
    python maint/fix_prose.py --write            # change it
    python maint/fix_prose.py --table other.tsv  # a different table

Each row of the table is a file, the exact text to find, and what it becomes, tab separated, with
\\n for a line break inside a field. The text must appear once in that file. Not zero times, which
means the source moved and the row is stale, and not twice, which means the site was not identified
uniquely and one of the two was never read.

WHY THE TABLE IS A SEPARATE FILE

A rewrite table has to quote the banned text it replaces. Held inside this module, that put those
phrases into a checked Python file and the gate flagged the tool for containing the very strings it
exists to remove. The table is data. It lives in prose_fixes.tsv, which the gate does not read, and
this module stays prose the gate can hold to its own standard.

Rows already applied report as `already` and are not an error, and a table can therefore be re-run
without being pruned first.

A replacement can itself be a finding. Three in this tree arrived as replacements for other banned
phrases, each costing a full round of edit, check, edit again. Every candidate is therefore put past
the gate before it is written, by asking the gate and never by keeping a second copy of its list.
