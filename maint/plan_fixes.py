"""Proposes a phrase swap for each finding, for build_fixes.py to turn into table rows.

The gate names a token, not a phrase: it reports the bare contrast word where the text carries its two-word form. A swap
has to act on the phrase, so each site is widened to the construction actually present and then a
rule is applied to that construction.

    python maint/plan_fixes.py src hooks > plan.tsv
    python maint/build_fixes.py plan.tsv --write
    python maint/fix_prose.py --write

Sites with no rule are printed to stderr and left for a person. That is the intended split: the
mechanical majority is one substitution with the sentence otherwise untouched, and everything else
needs the sentence read.

WHAT A RULE MAY DO

Swap a connective for one that carries the same relation. The two forms in the table below mark a
contrast between two parallel things, and where the two sides are parallel the swap says the same
thing. Where they are not, the result reads wrong, and for that reason every proposal goes through the
gate before it is written and every applied line is length-checked against the original afterward.
