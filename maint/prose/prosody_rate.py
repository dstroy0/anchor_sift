# Does this prose sound like a person wrote it? Answered as a rate against a drawn bar.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/prose/prosody_rate.py PATH [PATH ...]
#
# docs_check.py answers a different question. It reports every banned token it finds, so a file with
# no findings passes, and passing a ban list is not the same as reading human: a writer who avoids
# eight named phrases and keeps the rhythm that produced them still reads wrong, and the ban list
# only ever names the shapes somebody already noticed.
#
# This counts the same patterns as a RATE per hundred thousand words and puts it beside the three
# rates already measured in this tree, quoted in docs_check.py's own header:
#
#     643.4   assistant prose, 38,702 gated words of session transcript
#     387.9   human prose, 759,815 words of the research papers
#     112.8   this tree, after a day of repair
#
# Those are the bar, and they were drawn and not derived, which is the rule this tree applies to
# every other threshold. A file scoring near 643 reads like an assistant however clean its findings
# list is. A file near 112 reads like this tree.
#
# THE PATTERNS ARE IMPORTED AND NEVER COPIED. A second ban list is the same defect one level up, and
# check_fixes.py makes the same argument about the rewrite table.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT REPLACE
#
# anchor_sift/maint/prose/claudese_distance.py is the better instrument for the register question and
# it existed before this file did. It has two poles, a human corpus and a page written deliberately
# in the assistant register, and it places a file by which it sits nearer, with the margin reported
# against a band measured at that file's own word count. That is a positive control, and this file
# has none: a rate against three quoted numbers cannot say what a file resembles, only how often it
# uses named phrases.
#
# Run claudese_distance.py first. The one thing it states it does not measure is arrangement, since
# its file-level distances are taken on a bag of words and it says so at the foot of its own output.
# The RHYTHM section below is that missing half and is the only reason to run this.

    too small to carry the effect being claimed.

    sentences with forty-word ones; generated prose runs closer to its own mean. The statistic is the
