# Date a body of prose by its word choice, against six decades of papers in the same register.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/prose/prose_era.py [--markers N]
#
# THE THIRD STAGE OF THE SAME FILTER
#
# docs-check: quoting
# ban_evidence.py split the banned list into alphabet, word and phrase, and the three read different
# things off a text. The alphabet stage recovered the locale without being asked: neighbour fires at
# 17.3 per hundred thousand words in the papers and analyse at 8.9, because the proceedings are
# Canadian and British convention. This is the word stage, and the word stage carries the era.
# docs-check: end quoting
#
# The papers are dated. 81 of them open with a year from 1967 to 2013, and the ICSNL volumes carry
# their number, where volume n is the year 1965 + n. That is checked against two the extraction
# headers state outright: ICSNL 50 is 2015 and ICSNL 60 is 2025. Six decades, one register, one
# field, one conference. Vocabulary is the only thing free to move across them.
#
# ONLY ASCII WORDS ARE COUNTED
#
# These papers quote Salishan on every page. Counting every token would measure how much language
# data a paper prints, which changes with the decade for reasons that have nothing to do with how
# anybody writes. The count here is restricted to runs of ASCII letters, the English the
# linguist wrote around the data.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT DO
#
# A decade holds a dozen papers and a handful of authors, so an author and their decade are not
# separable here. A word can date a text or it can name the person who liked it. The marker list
# below is printed with the count of distinct papers each word appears in, and a marker sitting in
# one or two papers is one writer's habit wearing a decade's clothes.
