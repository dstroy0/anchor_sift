# Take the assistant's own prose out of a session transcript, as a pole with known provenance.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/prose/session_prose.py <transcript.jsonl> [--out <file>]
#
# WHY A TRANSCRIPT BEATS A PUBLISHED CORPUS HERE
#
# Every dataset on a public host carries a model name that nobody outside can verify, and the one
# time that was tested here it failed: a corpus labeled as an earlier model generation, two years
# older, fired the eight phrases this repository had confirmed as the assistant signature at 1.3
# per hundred thousand words against this tree at 26.4, and that reading said the phrases were
# local to the tree. It was wrong.
# A transcript needs no label. The assistant turns in it were written by the model that wrote them.
#
# WHAT IS TAKEN
#
# Only the text blocks of assistant messages. Not the user's turns, which are the other party's
# words. Not tool calls or tool results, which are file contents and command output and would put
# this repository's own text into a pole meant to be independent of it. Not thinking blocks, which
# are a different register from prose written to be read.
#
# THE CONFOUND, AND IT IS A LARGE ONE
#
# The assistant wrote this transcript while enforcing a banned phrase list across the tree, and was
# avoiding those phrases in its own messages the whole time. A rate measured here is a rate under
# suppression, and it understates whatever the unconstrained rate would be. It is a floor on the
# register and not an estimate of it. The same fault, in the same direction, as measuring this
# repository after a day of scrubbing it.
#
# One session, one task, one reader. Register is technical and agentic throughout, so nothing here
# speaks for how the model writes about anything else.
