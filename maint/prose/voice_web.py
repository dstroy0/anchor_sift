#       python maint/prose/voice_web.py
#
# Reads the text voice_pdftotext.sh wrote to build/voice/text/ and the words voice_count.py kept in
# voice.tsv, and writes three tables to maint/prose/. Each holds counts only.
#
#   voice_alphabet.tsv         every character the voice uses, with its count, most frequent first.
#                              The rank is the position the engine's web gives it.
#   voice_character_web.tsv    which of the commonest 64 characters follows which, as counts. This
#                              is measure/web.py's web() over the same text with the shares left
#                              as counts: a cell's share is its count over the table's total.
#   voice_word_web.tsv         which voice word follows which, as counts. The pairs are the ones
#                              claudese_distance.web_profile counts, over voice.tsv's words only.
#
# All three read the text voice.tsv is counted from, normalized by voice_count.normalized(). Every
# run of whitespace is then read as one space. pdftotext breaks lines where the page did, and a line break is
# the typesetter's.
#
# A pair is never counted across something dropped. In the character web a character past rank 64
# ends the run, as it does in web(). In the word web a word that voice_count.py pulled for review
# ends it. Two words are also a pair only when nothing stands between them but spaces, commas,
# quotes, brackets and dashes. A period, a question mark, a colon, a semicolon, a digit or a symbol
# from an equation ends the run, because the words on either side of one were not written as a pair.
