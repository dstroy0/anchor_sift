# Pull the readable prose out of a document and leave the mathematics behind.
#
#   Usage:  python tools/prose/plain_text.py [--out FILE] [--min-words N] path [path ...]
#
# WHY THE MATHEMATICS HAS TO COME OUT
#
# A detector scores register. Handed a table of residuals or a line of TeX it returns 1.000 and the
# number means nothing: a column of figures is not written in any register at all. The first sweep
# through this tree proved it - seven of its top eight findings were tables, and the one real
# sentence in the list was buried under them.
#
# So this strips every construct that is notation and keeps every construct that is language:
#
#     removed   fenced code, indented code, inline code spans
#     removed   display and inline TeX, tabular bodies, TeX-only lines
#     removed   markdown and TeX table rows, rules, banners
#     removed   any line whose characters are mostly not letters
#     kept      sentences, including sentences that mention a number
#
# THE LAST TWO ARE A DELIBERATE PAIR. "The transform ran in 680 ms" is prose about a measurement and
# stays; "| 4096 | 2006 | 680 |" is the measurement itself and goes. The test is whether the line
# reads as a sentence, not whether it contains a digit, because a rule that dropped every digit
# would drop most of the real writing in this tree.
#
# WHAT COMES OUT IS FOR PASTING SOMEWHERE
#
# The output is paragraphs separated by blank lines, with no markers, no numbering and no headings
# left over. That is the form a detector's text box wants, and it is also the form a person reads
# aloud to hear whether a sentence sounds like a person wrote it.
#
# ONE THING IT IS NOT: this makes no judgment. It does not score, flag, or rank. It hands over clean
# text, and the reading happens somewhere else.
