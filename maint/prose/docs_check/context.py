# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE SUBJECT IS BRITISH, AND OTHER RUN-LEVEL CONTEXT
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A British convention is banned unless the subject IS British convention, and this is that clause.
# A passage about it has to be able to write the word it is about. "British English writes colour"
# is a correct sentence, and an alphabet-stage finding on it is the same error as a checker
# reporting a standard for naming its own bans.
#
# THIS EXTENDS THE COMPILED CONTEXT EXEMPTION QUOTED ALREADY IS. That tuple exists for exactly this
# question one instance at a time: the International Conference on Salish and Neighbouring Languages
# spells its own name that way and thirteen extraction headers cite it. Pointing this at the same
# shape is why it is two tuples of compiled patterns and not a new stage.
#
# BOUNDED TO THE ALPHABET TIER AND TO THE RUN, and that keeps it from being a bypass. A
# paragraph mentioning Canada does not get to write `is what makes`. Only a convention finding goes
# quiet, and only inside the run carrying the subject.
#
# THE SUBJECT IS THE CONVENTION AND NOT THE COUNTRY, and the pattern says so. A bare \bbritish\b
# would exempt "British Telecom's optimisation", where the subject is a company and the convention
# is a live finding. Each arm names a word about writing: `english`, `spelling`, `convention`,
# `usage`, `variant`, `orthography`.
#
# THE COST OF THIS ARM IS ZERO FINDINGS SILENCED across every tree here, because nothing in them
# writes about the convention. The rule is the objective's own clause written down before a
# document needs it. maint/prose/test_docs_check_exclusions.py re-derives that zero from the trees
# on disk, so a reader checks it instead of trusting this sentence.

# field spelled the way its document spells it, quoted in a Doxygen brief with its default.
# Rewriting a field name makes a comment cite something that is not in the document it names.
#
# THIS IS A REWRITE ERROR AND NOT A SCAN EXEMPTION. Written as a scan exemption it silences the
# register gate in any tree that cites a standard in most of its comments, which is the kind of
# tree it exists for. Bounded to the alphabet tier it silences ordinary prose that happens to sit
# in a paragraph citing a standard, and reaches no field name at all. A published field name is
# rarely a locale form in the first place, so there is nothing for the exemption to buy.
#
# A rule that silences correct findings and buys nothing is a net loss, and precision over
# recall means exactly that when it costs something. So it moved to fix_error, where it errors on a
# rewrite on a line quoting a named standard and costs nothing at all.

# without IGNORECASE on purpose: "this may be null" is prose and "the sender MAY retransmit" is a
# requirement whose wording is not this tree's to edit.
#
# NOT A SCAN EXEMPTION. Nothing in BANNED matches a capitalized normative keyword. Exempting a
# run for carrying one would buy nothing and cost whatever else is in the run. It is a rewrite
# error and only that: a line carrying one is never rewritten, because reflowing a requirement is
# how a requirement stops being the one that was agreed.
