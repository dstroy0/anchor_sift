# What the checker can be asked besides whether the tree passes.
#
# A repair needs three things the scan does not give: the word this writing would use in a place,
# the words in the tree that have no warrant at all, and the lines a finding actually sits on. Each
# of those is a reading of the same tables and the same walk the scan already does, which is why
# they belong here instead of in five scripts that each rebuild the roots and the file list.
#
# A READING NEVER FAILS ANYTHING. Every one of these exits 0 when it had something to print and 4
# when the request could not be parsed. None of them returns 1, 2 or 3: those belong to the run and
# a hook reads them.
