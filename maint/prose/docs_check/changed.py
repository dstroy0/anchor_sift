# Which lines a change added, so a finding on one can be told from a finding it inherited.
#
# A file carrying a hundred older findings buries the three a change just wrote, and the three are
# the only ones whose author is still at the keyboard. --changed reads the files the diff touches
# and keeps the findings whose line the diff added. A file new to the tree counts every line.
#
# THIS NARROWS THE REPORT AND NEVER THE READ. Every finding in every touched file is still computed
# and the ratchet still sees all of them, because a count that depended on which lines a diff
# happened to touch would ratchet down on a commit that only moved code around.
