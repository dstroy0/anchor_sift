    report the same words twice: "which is exactly what" matches both which-is-what and
    is-exactly-what, and repairing the sentence closes both at once.

    banned_tokens turns these into the findings a reader sees, and submission_check counts them per
    pattern against the rate a human writer carries. Both read the same hits. A count and a
    finding cannot disagree about what fired.

    quotations exempts a long quoted passage and the markdown citation spans, and is set for .md.

    comments turns on the COMMENT_ONLY patterns, which are the ones a standard scopes to a comment
    in the sentence that bans them. main() sets it for the extensions whose prose lives in comments.
    It defaults off. A caller that has not been taught the scope gets the documentation reading,
    the one both standards share. submission_check.py is that caller.

    The run-level context exemption is applied here, beside QUOTED, because it answers the same
    question QUOTED does about a different subject: a run whose subject is a writing convention has
    to be able to write the word it is about. It is tier-aware and QUOTED is not. It cannot be a
    span list, and it is the single call site in this file that knows both the run and the tier.

# The only human corpus this file has a rate against, named wherever a rate is printed.
#
# It is the 154 research papers under build/papers, cut down to English by english_gate, which is
# 759,815 words. They are Salishan linguistics: Canadian and British convention throughout, carrying
# orthography, interlinear glosses, IPA and tables of forms. english_gate's own header names
# ban_evidence.py, which generates HUMAN_RATE, as one of three measurements this corpus corrupted,
# and the header above HUMAN_RATE records that correction.
#
# WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND IT WAS WRONG TWICE OVER. The unmeasured branch printed "unused in 1.1M
# human words". 1,108,054 is the UNGATED token count, which the HUMAN_RATE header states is the
# wrong denominator and low by about 40 percent, while the measured branch beside it was already
# dividing by 759,815. Two branches, two denominators, one corpus, in eleven lines of each other.
# And "human words" describes a general English sample, which 154 linguistics papers are not: the
# sentence read as a claim about English and was a claim about these papers.
#
# THE UNMEASURED BRANCH IS THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF WHAT THIS TOOL PRINTS, because most banned
# patterns have no measured rate. A misdescription there is not an edge case in the report, it is
# almost the whole of it, so the wording on that branch matters more than the wording anywhere else.
#
# Absence from these papers is weak evidence and the wording now says which papers. A reader can
# weigh it. A phrase can be missing because the domain is. Re-cut this against an English corpus, or
# keep naming the corpus. Never print a rate or an absence without the corpus behind it.
