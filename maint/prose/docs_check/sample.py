# Assemble one continuous sample of this project's prose, for a detector that takes pasted text.
#
#   python maint/prose/docs_check --sample --words 10000 theory
#   python maint/prose/docs_check --sample --words 4000 theory/theory/millennium
#
# Writes build/gate/sample.txt and prints the word count, the character count, and every file that
# went into it with its share. The manifest is the point: a detector returns one number over the
# whole paste, and without a manifest nobody can say afterward what that number was measured on.
#
# The extraction is docs_check's. This and the banned list read the same words. A .tex arrives
# with its markup blanked and a source file with its code blanked, and neither a path nor a label
# reaches the detector as though it were a sentence.
#
# Files are taken in the order given and truncated at a paragraph boundary when the budget runs out,
# , a sample is a set of whole paragraphs and never a sentence cut in half.
#
# The closed corpus and the private repositories never go in. A pasted sample is published the
# moment it is pasted, and the hand extractions are the papers' text and the speakers' words.
