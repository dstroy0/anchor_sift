"""Runs the prose gate over LaTeX, which the gate itself does not read.

docs_check.py checks .md, .py, .c and .h. Pointed at this tree's theory/ it reports six files and
exits clean while skipping fifteen .tex files carrying 11,409 words, which is most of the prose in
the repository. That is not the checker being wrong; it is the checker being pointed at a format it
never claimed. The count at the foot of the run is the only signal, and a number that looks like an
answer is the failure this whole class shares.

So the LaTeX is reduced to plain text here and the gate is run on that.

    python maint/grade_tex.py                 # every .tex under theory/
    python maint/grade_tex.py path.tex ...    # named files
    python maint/grade_tex.py --strict        # every note becomes breaking

WHY ONE OUTPUT LINE PER INPUT LINE

Every finding the gate reports carries a line number, and a number that points into a stripped
temporary file is useless to whoever has to fix it. So the reduction is line by line and never
reflows: line 40 of the plain text is line 40 of the .tex, and the findings are rewritten to name
the real file. A stripper that joined paragraphs would read better and report nothing anyone could
act on.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO

It does not parse LaTeX. Macros are stripped by pattern, and the argument of a text-bearing command
is kept while the command itself goes. Maths comes out entirely: the gate measures English and an
equation is not English. Where a construct is not recognized the text is left in place and never
dropped, and a hit may therefore land on something that was never prose. That is the right way to be
wrong in: a false finding is read and dismissed, a dropped paragraph is never graded at all.
