"""The per-repository settings a tool reads instead of carrying a copy of them.

`repotools.toml` sits at the root of every repository that adopts the toolkit. It answers the four
questions that were the only difference between eight copies of the same script: what the project is
called, what license line its files carry, where its source lives, and which file extensions count.

    from repotools import config

    cfg = config.load()                   # walks up from the working directory
    cfg = config.load("src/carcer.c")     # walks up from a path

    cfg.project_name()                    # "MMgr"
    cfg.header()                          # the two comment lines a generated file opens with
    cfg.source_roots()                    # absolute paths
    cfg.code_extensions()                 # (".c", ".h")
    cfg.is_excluded(path)                 # build, site, vendor and whatever else the repo lists

Every setting has a default here, so a repository states what differs from the defaults and stays
short. `defaults.toml` beside this file holds them, and a reader comparing a repository's file
against it sees the repository's decisions on one screen.

WHAT DOES NOT BELONG IN THIS FILE

A setting only one repository will ever set is a setting that repository keeps for itself. The line
between them is whether a second repository would answer the question differently. `[project] name`
qualifies. A Salishan paper's font repair table does not, and it stays in the repository that reads
it.
