"""One entry point for the toolkit, so a tool is findable without knowing where it sits.

    repotools sets                 the tool sets this toolkit offers
    repotools list                 every tool, by set, with the line its docstring opens with
    repotools fetch [set ...]      copy this repository's sets in from the toolkit, write the lock
    repotools check                report a fetched file edited here, or one the toolkit moved past
    repotools adopt <path> <set>   promote one of this repository's tools into the toolkit
    repotools inventory <dir> ...  which tool is written more than once across these trees
    repotools prose [path ...]     the prose checker, resolved without naming its location
    repotools hooks install        point git at the toolkit's hook driver
    repotools config               what this repository's repotools.toml resolves to

Every tool stays runnable by its own path. This entry point exists to make a tool findable, and a
tool reachable only through here would break the moment somebody moved it.

On Windows run `bin/repotools.ps1` from PowerShell. `bin/repotools` is a sh script and wants Git
Bash. Both take the same commands.
