"""Moving tools between this toolkit and the repositories that use it, in both directions.

The toolkit is upstream. A repository fetches from it and never pushes back by editing a fetched
file in place. Where a repository has a tool worth sharing, it is promoted here deliberately with
`adopt`, and every other repository then fetches the promoted copy.

    fetch(cfg)        toolkit -> repository. Copies the sets the repository asked for, stamps each
                      file, writes repotools.lock.
    check(cfg)        reports a fetched file edited in the repository, and one the toolkit has moved
                      past. The first refuses. The second is a note saying a fetch is due.
    adopt(path)       repository -> toolkit. Brings one file in, records where it came from, and
                      reports what still carries that repository's name.

WHAT THE LOCK COVERS, AND WHAT IT IGNORES

`repotools.lock` lists the files that came from here. A repository's own tools are its own, and
nothing in this module reads them, reports on them or has an opinion about them. The lock is the
boundary: inside it the toolkit is the source, outside it the repository is.

THE STAMP, NOT THE PATH

Each fetched file carries a stamp line naming the toolkit path it came from and the digest of the
content that was installed. Identity is the stamp. A repository that moves a fetched file into a
different directory still matches, because the check reads the stamp and never infers identity from
where the file sits. The alternative was measured next door: a registry that matched examples on
path alone read a move as one example retired and another created, which burned the number and broke
every citation to it.

THE HEADER STAYS THIS TOOLKIT'S

A fetched file keeps the repo_tools copyright and license header. It is this toolkit's code running
in another tree. The fetching project's name, version and license reach the tool at runtime through
its own `repotools.toml`, which is the entire reason the eight copies of `codemask.py` differed.
