"""Builds fix-table rows by swapping one phrase inside a line, with the rest copied from the file.

WHY THIS EXISTS

The first attempt at the source tree typed whole replacement lines from a report that truncates its
display at ninety-two characters. Twenty lines lost the end of a sentence: "A winner cleared the"
became "A winner cle". Every one of those still cleared its finding, so the gate went green on
twenty mutilated comments, and only a length comparison against the original found them.

So no replacement is typed here. A caller names a file, a line, the phrase to remove and the phrase
to put in its place. Everything around the phrase is read out of the file and copied verbatim into
both sides of the row, which makes losing the tail of a line impossible instead of unlikely.

    python maint/build_fixes.py plan.tsv        # report the rows it would add
    python maint/build_fixes.py plan.tsv --write

A plan row is four fields: file, line number, exact phrase to remove, phrase to put in its place.
The phrase must appear on that line. The window taken around it grows until it is unique in the
file, and a phrase that cannot be made unique is reported instead of guessed at.
